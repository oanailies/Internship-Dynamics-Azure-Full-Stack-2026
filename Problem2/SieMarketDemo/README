# SieMarketDemo

This project is a small C# console demo that models an online electronics store scenario.

I implemented the domain model using Customer and CustomerId, Order and OrderId, and OrderItem. 
An Order contains one customer and a list of order items. Each OrderItem stores product name, quantity,
unit price at purchase time, and can compute its line total.

The order price calculation follows the required discount rule. The subtotal is computed as the sum of all item 
line totals. A discount policy is applied so that if the subtotal is greater than 500 EUR, a 
10 percent discount is applied to the entire order. I kept the discount logic in a separate policy 
class to make the rule easy to change without modifying the Order class.

For analytics, I added a method that finds the top spender customer by grouping orders per customer and 
summing the final prices across all their orders. I also added the bonus method that returns popular products 
together with the total quantity sold by aggregating all items across all orders and grouping them by product name.

In Program.cs I created multiple customers and a larger set of test orders to cover different scenarios like 
orders under 500, exactly 500, and over 500, and repeated products across different orders.
The console output prints per-order details, totals per customer, the top spender, and the popular products list, 
including a sanity check that validates the aggregated quantities.
