Class Diagram (UML)
In my class diagram, I model a coffee shop ordering system.

A CoffeeShop represents one store. One coffee shop has many baristas and it receives many orders, because multiple customers can order in the same location.

A Barista is an employee who prepares orders. One barista can prepare many orders, but each order is prepared by one barista. Sometimes the order can 
be not assigned yet, so the barista can be optional until the order is taken.

A Customer can place many orders. Each customer has one LoyaltyAccount. The LoyaltyAccount stores the membership type, Regular or Gold, 
and the current points balance. Regular customers earn 1 point per 1 euro spent and Gold customers earn 2 points per 1 euro spent. 
Customers can also redeem points to get free drinks.

An Order stores the timestamp when it was created, the status (created, preparing, completed, cancelled), the total price, and the earned points. 
Each order belongs to one coffee shop and one customer, and it can be assigned to one barista. An order contains many OrderItems.

An OrderItem is one line in the order. It stores which drink was ordered (MenuItem), which size (Small/Medium/Large), the quantity, and the chosen extras. 
For efficiency, I store snapshot prices inside OrderItem: the base price, the extras price, and the line total. 
This keeps the order correct even if menu prices change later.

A MenuItem is a drink type like Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino. Each menu item has three prices, one for each size, stored in MenuItemPrice.

An Extra is an add-on like extra shot, vanilla syrup, caramel syrup, or whipped cream. 
One order item can have many extras, and the same extra can be used in many order items.


Database Diagram (ERD)
In the database diagram, I translate the same model into tables with primary keys and foreign keys.

I store the stores in a CoffeeShop table with shop_id as primary key, plus name and address. 
Baristas are stored in a Barista table with barista_id as primary key and shop_id as foreign key, because each barista works in one coffee shop, while one coffee shop has many baristas.

Customers are stored in a Customer table with customer_id as primary key, full_name, and email. 
Loyalty is stored in a LoyaltyAccount table with loyalty_id as primary key and customer_id as a foreign key that is also unique, 
so each customer has exactly one loyalty account. In the loyalty table I store the tier (Regular or Gold) and the points_balance.

The menu is stored in MenuItem, where each drink type has menu_item_id as primary key and a name. 
The size-based pricing is stored in MenuItemPrice, where I keep menu_item_id as a foreign key, size (Small/Medium/Large), and price. 
I also keep a unique constraint on (menu_item_id, size) so each drink has exactly one price per size. Extras are stored in an Extra table 
with extra_id as primary key, name, and additional_cost.

Orders are stored in an Orders table with order_id as primary key. It has shop_id and customer_id as foreign keys, 
and barista_id as a foreign key that can be null until the order is assigned. It also stores the order timestamp, status, total_price, and earned_points.

Each item inside an order is stored in OrderItem with order_item_id as primary key. It has order_id as a foreign key, menu_item_id as a foreign key, size, and quantity. For efficiency and correct history, I store snapshot pricing fields on OrderItem: unit_base_price, unit_extras_price, and line_total.

Because an order item can have multiple extras and an extra can appear in many order items, I use a junction table OrderItemExtra with a composite primary key (order_item_id, extra_id). Optionally, I also store extra_cost_at_time to snapshot the extra price as well.
