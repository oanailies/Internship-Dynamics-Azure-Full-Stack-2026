In my class diagram, I model a coffee shop ordering system.
CoffeeShop
A CoffeeShop represents one store.
One coffee shop has many baristas and it also receives many orders.

Barista
A Barista is an employee who prepares orders.
One barista can prepare many orders, but each order is prepared by one barista (or it can be not assigned yet).

Customer + LoyaltyAccount
A Customer can place many orders.
Each customer has one LoyaltyAccount.

The LoyaltyAccount stores:
the membership type: Regular or Gold
the current points balance

Regular earns 1 point per 1 euro, Gold earns 2 points per 1 euro.
Customers can also redeem points to get free drinks.

Order
An Order stores:
timestamp (when it was created)
status (created / preparing / completed)
total price
earned points

An order contains many OrderItems.
OrderItem
An OrderItem is one line in the order:
which drink (MenuItem)
which size (Small/Medium/Large)
quantity
chosen extras

For efficiency, I store “snapshot prices” in OrderItem:
base price
extras price
line total

This keeps the order correct even if menu prices change later.

MenuItem + MenuItemPrice

A MenuItem is a drink type: Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino.
Each menu item has 3 prices, one per size, stored in MenuItemPrice.

Extra

An Extra is an add-on like extra shot, vanilla syrup, etc.
One order item can have many extras, and the same extra can be used in many order items.
